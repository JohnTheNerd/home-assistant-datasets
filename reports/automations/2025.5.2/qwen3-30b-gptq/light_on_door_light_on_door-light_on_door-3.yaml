    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here is a blueprint automation for Home Assistant to turn on a light when a door opens and turn it off when the door closes or after 2 minutes:

  ```yaml
  name: "Light on door"
  description: "Turn on a light when a door opens and turn it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
  inputs:
    door_sensor:
      name: "Door Sensor"
      description: "The binary sensor that detects when the door opens."
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: binary_sensor
    light_switch:
      name: "Light Switch"
      description: "The light(s) to turn on when the door opens."
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: light

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ input_door_sensor }}"
      to: 'on'

  condition: []
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ input_light_switch }}"
    - delay: '00:02:00'
    - service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ input_light_switch }}"
    - service: homeassistant.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ input_light_switch }}"
      data:
        transition: 5
  ```

  ### How it works:
  - When the door sensor changes to `on` (door opens), it turns on the specified light.
  - After 2 minutes, it turns off the light.
  - The light is also turned off if the door closes (you may need to add another trigger for that, depending on your setup).
