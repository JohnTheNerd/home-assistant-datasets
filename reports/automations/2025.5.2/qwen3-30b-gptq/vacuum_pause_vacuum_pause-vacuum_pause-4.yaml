    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  This is a blueprint automation to pause a vacuum when a phone call is received.

  ### Inputs:
  - `phone_call_sensor`: A `binary_sensor` that triggers when a phone call is received.
  - `vacuum_entity`: A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.

  ### Automation:
  1. When the `phone_call_sensor` is triggered (on),
  2. And the `vacuum_entity` is in "running" state,
  3. Then pause the vacuum.

  The vacuum can be resumed manually.
