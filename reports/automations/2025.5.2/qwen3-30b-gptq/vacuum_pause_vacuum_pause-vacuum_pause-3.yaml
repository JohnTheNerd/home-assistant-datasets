    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here is a blueprint automation for Home Assistant to pause your vacuum when a phone call is received:

  ```yaml
  name: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
  description: "Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received."
  default_config:
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: '{{ phone_call_sensor }}'
        to: 'on'
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: '{{ vacuum_entity }}'
        state: 'cleaning'
    action:
      - service: vacuum.pause
        target:
          entity_id: '{{ vacuum_entity }}'
  ```

  To use this blueprint, you need to provide the binary sensor for the phone call and the vacuum entity. The automation will pause the vacuum only when it's cleaning and a phone call is detected.
