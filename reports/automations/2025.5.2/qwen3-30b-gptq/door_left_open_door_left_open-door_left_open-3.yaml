    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here is a blueprint automation for Home Assistant to play an alert when a door is left open:

  ```yaml
  alias: Door Left Open Alert
  description: Plays an alert on the speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.
  input:
    door_sensor:
      name: "Door Sensor"
      description: "A binary sensor entity that detects if the door is open."
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: binary_sensor
    alert_media:
      name: "Alert Media"
      description: "The media to play when the door is left open."
      selector:
        media:
          domain: media_player
          media_id: true
    open_duration:
      name: "Open Duration"
      description: "The duration the door must be open before the alert is played."
      selector:
        duration: {}
  trigger:
    - platform: template
      value_template: "{{ is_state(trigger.entity_id, 'open') }}"
      for:
        minutes: "{{ trigger.event.data['duration'] | int }}"
  condition: []
  action:
    - media_player/play_media:
        entity_id: "{{ trigger.event.data['entity_id'] }}"
        media_id: "{{ input.alert_media.media_id }}"
        media_content_type: "audio"
  mode: single
  ```

  To use this blueprint:
  1. Add it to your Home Assistant configuration.
  2. Replace the inputs with your specific entities and settings.
  3. The automation will trigger when the door is open for the specified duration and play the selected alert on the speaker.
