    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  To create a blueprint automation for a humidity fan in Home Assistant, follow these steps:

  1. Go to **Automations** > **Create Automation**.
  2. Choose **Use YAML** to edit the automation directly.
  3. Paste the following YAML code:

  ```yaml
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: {{ humidity_sensor }}
      to: "{{ humidity_level }}"
      for:
        minutes: 1
  action:
    - service: fan.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: {{ fan_entity }}
      data: {}
  ```

  4. Replace `{{ humidity_sensor }}`, `{{ humidity_level }}`, and `{{ fan_entity }}` with the actual entity IDs for your humidity sensor, desired humidity level, and fan.
  5. Save and test the automation.

  This automation will turn on the fan when the humidity level exceeds the specified threshold. It will not try to turn the fan on if it's already on.
