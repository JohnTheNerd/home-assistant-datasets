    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here is a blueprint automation for Home Assistant to play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: "Door Left Open Alert"
    description: "Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration."
    inputs:
      door_sensor:
        name: "Door Sensor"
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      alert_media:
        name: "Alert Media"
        selector:
          media:
            domain: media_player
      open_duration:
        name: "Open Duration"
        selector:
          duration: {}
    triggers:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: {{ input_door_sensor }}
        to: 'on'
    conditions:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.old_state.state == 'off' }}"
    actions:
      - service: media_player/play_media
        target:
          entity_id: {{ input_alert_media.media_player }}
        data:
          media_id: {{ input_alert_media.media_id }}
  ```

  ### How to use:
  1. Replace `door_sensor` with the binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
  2. Select the media player and media ID for the alert.
  3. Set the duration (e.g., 30 minutes).

  This will play the selected media when the door is left open for the specified time.
