The automation should not try to\nturn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is\nalready off.\n","","To create a blueprint for turning on a fan based on humidity levels, you can use the following:\n\n### Blueprint Structure\n\n1. Import necessary entities:\n```python\nfrom homeassistant.components.humidity import Sensor, HumidityEntity\n```\n2. Define the automation logic:\n```python\ndef setup(automation, hass):\n    sensor = hass.data[humidity_data.id]\n    \n    @automation.on_change(hass, {\n        'humidity_level': lambda v: on_turn_on(sensor, humidity, v),\n        'fan_entity': lambda v: turn_off(fan, sensor, v)\n    })\n```\n### Explanation\n\n- **sensor**: A `Sensor` entity that represents the humidty sensor.\n  - The `on_change` method ensures that when the value of the sensor changes (e.g., by adding humidity), the automation is triggered accordingly.\n  \n  - You can define how to handle changes using lambda functions or custom logic.\n\n- **automation.on_change**: This allows you to specify callbacks for changes in a blueprint. It updates the `automation` variable passed as `automation`.\n\n- **on_turn_on**: When the sensor value goes above a specific threshold, turn on the fan.\n  - The variable `_automation` is used to store this logic within the automation.\n\n- **turn_off**: When the sensor level goes below that threshold, turn off the fan.\n  \n  - This method should be placed in the blueprint configuration or as an entity state. \n\n### Example Configuration\n\nFor example, if you want to automate turning on the bathroom exhaust fan when the humidity is above 60%:\n\n```python\nautomation = hass.config_entries.flow.before_change[1]\nautomation.on_change(hass, {\n    'humidity_level': lambda v: on_turn_on(sensor, humidity, v),\n    'fan_entity': lambda v: turn_off(fan, sensor, v)\n})\n```\n\n### Custom Logic\n\n- **on_turn_on**: If the `humidity_sensor` value goes above 60%:\n```python\ndef on_turn_on(sensor, humidity, level):\n    if humidity > 60:\n        fan.turn_on()\n```\n  - Ensure to replace `fan` with the actual fan entity that needs to be turned on when the condition is met.\n\n- **turn_off**: If the `humidity_sensor` value goes below 60%:\n```python\ndef turn_off(fan, sensor, level):\n    if humidity < 60:\n        fan.turn_off()\n```\n  - Ensure to replace `fan` with the actual fan entity that needs to be turned off when the condition is met.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **fan_entity**: The `FanEntity` that represents the fan. You should choose a suitable entity for your use case.\n  \n- **sensor**: If you are using multiple sensors, this should be the first sensor in your automation.\n\n- **humidity_level**: The value used as the trigger to turn on or off the fan. It can range from 0% to 100%.\n\nRemember that depending on how you configure your system, there might not always be a direct link between the humidity and the fan level. You might need to extend or modify the logic accordingly.","humidity_fan-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","AssertionError: Blueprint content is not available"

Define Blueprint\n- Create a blueprint with the following structure:\n\n```yaml\nblueprints:\n  - name: 'Humidity Fan'\n    actions:\n      - name: 'Turn on fan when humidty is above 60%'\n        entity_id: sensor.humidity\n\n      - name: 'Stop fan when humidity level drops below 60%'\n        action_id: \n          type: 'stop_fan'\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Blueprint\n\n1. **Entities:**\n   - `sensor.humidity`: This is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation.\n   - `fan.entity`: The entity that will control the fan switch.\n\n2. **Actions:**\n   - We define two actions:\n     - `'Turn on fan when humidty is above 60%'`: If the humidity level goes above 60%, turn on the fan.\n     - `'Stop fan when humidity level drops below 60%'`: Stop the fan if the humidity level goes below 60%.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n1. **Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%:**\n   - When the sensor for the bathroom humidty measures at or above 60%, the automation will turn on the fan.\n\n2. **Make sure the garage does not get too humid:**\n   - When the sensor for the garage humidity level goes below 60%, the automation should stop the fan, ensuring it doesn't disturb the air quality of your garage.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This blueprint is a simple example and can be expanded to handle more complex conditions.\n- You may need to adjust the `fan_entity` to match the specific interface you are using with Home Assistant.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."

The automation should not try to\nturn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is\nalready off.\n","","To create a blueprint for turning on the fan based on the humidity sensor's value:\n\n1. First, add a `sensor` entity for the humidty sensor (`humidity_sensor`) that triggers the automation.\n2. Next, configure an `entity_data` to store the current humidity level:\n   - Set up a `number_entity` and specify its name (`humidity_level`).\n   - Create an `update_every` of 10 seconds (to ensure every second) so that it updates as needed.\n3. Then, add an `action` with two inputs:\n    - `value`: The current humidity level, which is given in percentage.\n    - `action`: A button or action that turns on the fan when its value exceeds the `humidity_level`.\n\n   ```yaml\n   # Humidity Fan\n   - entity_id: sensor.humidity_sensor\n     name: 'Humidity Sensor'\n     polling_frequency: 10s\n\n   - number_entity:\n      name: humidity_level\n      value_template: '{{ data('sensor.humidity_sensor') }}'\n      update_every: 10s\n   ```\n\n4. Finally, connect the `action` to a button or action that triggers the automation:\n\n```yaml\n- entity_id: fan\n  name: 'Fan'\n  method: 'on'\n  trigger_entity_id: humidity_level\n```\n\nThis blueprint sets up an automation that starts the fan if the humidty sensor detects an above average level, stops it when it goes below the desired level, and only turns it back on when its value is within acceptable limits.","humidity_fan-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'"

The\nlight should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.\n","","To implement this blueprint automation for turning on a light based on whether the door is open, you can use the `light` component along with some logic to handle the timing.\n\nFirst, add a sensor (e.g., a `binary_sensor`) that triggers the automation when the door opens. Then, create two components:\n\n1. A light (`light`) component connected to the door (`door_sensor`) and controlled by the temperature of the room.\n2. An action (`trigger`) that will be triggered on the `light` if the door opens.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```yaml\n# Home Assistant YAML Blueprint\n\nimport { Light, BinarySensor } from 'home-assistant';\n\nlet door = BinarySensor('door_sensor', { type: 'binary_sensor' });\n\nconst light = new Light({\n  name: 'My Door Light',\n  entity_id: `${door.entity_id}`,\n});\n\n// Set up the action that triggers when the door opens\nlight.action.on = async () => {\n  // Delay for 2 minutes (adjust as needed)\n  await delay(180);\n  \n  // Turn on the light component with a temperature of 50°C\n  await light.set_temperature(50, true);\n\n  // Optionally, set a timeout to ensure the light is turned off after the door closes\n  if (door.is_open) {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      console.log('Door closed.

It will control the temperature of the room with a specific value (e.g., 50°C in this example).\n- **Action**: When the door opens, the action triggers by setting the temperature of the room to 50°C.\n  \n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **Room Temperature**: The temperature is calculated and set based on the current room's temperature. You can adjust this value if needed.\n\n2. **Timeout (Optional)**: If you want the light to turn off after a door closes, you can add `setTimeout()`.\n\n3. **Security Note**: This setup assumes that the temperature sensor is within your home's electrical system and not connected to any external sensors or devices.\n\n### Running the Automation:\n\n1. Run the main function to start the automation.\n2. Adjust the room temperature as needed.\n3. Set up triggers for light switches if you wish to turn off the lights.\n\nThis blueprint can be easily integrated into your Home Assistant project by adding more conditions and actions that may be necessary depending on your specific needs.","light_on_door-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","^,AssertionError: Blueprint was not valid yaml: mapping values are not allowed here   in '<unicode string>', line 5, column 46:      ... narySensor('door_sensor', { type: 'binary_sensor' });                                          ^"

The\nlight should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.\n","","To achieve the desired functionality of turning on a light when the door is open,\nyou can create a blueprint that triggers an automation whenever the `door_sensor`\n(controls whether the door opens) changes to 'ON.' The automation will then switch off the specified light \ntarget once the door has been opened.\n\n### 1. Define Entities\n\n- **`DoorSensor`**: This sensor will detect when the door is open.\n- **`LightSwitch`**: This entity will control if the light should turn on or off based on the state of the `door_sensor`.\n  \n### 2. Create Blueprint\n\nHere's a blueprint using Python and the Home Assistant programming language, which uses the `light_switch` to control the `DoorSensor`.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nfrom homeassistant.core import State\nfrom homeassistant.helpers.entity import Entity\nfrom homeassistant.helpers.entity_registry import EntityRegistry\n\nfrom homeassistant.const import STATE_ON, STATE_OFF, STATE_CLOSED\n\n# Define your entities here:\ndoor_sensor = EntityRegistry.get_or_create_entity(\n    'sensor.door', 'DoorSensor', config_entry=EntityRegistry.get_config('sensor.door')\n)\nlight_switch = [EntityRegistry.get_entity(STATE_ON, 'LightSwitch'), ] # One or more LightSwitches to turn on/off\n\n# Define the blueprint\nblueprint = f'''\n{\n  '$schema': 'https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema',\n  'title': 'TurnOnLightWhenDoorOpensBlueprint',\n  'type': 'object',\n  'properties': {\n    'door_sensor': {\n      'type': 'binary_sensor',\n      'name': 'DoorSensor',\n      'state_topic': f'entities/{door_sensor.entity_id}',\n      'entity_id': 'light_switch.0'\n    }\n  },\n  'actions': [\n    {\n      'action': 'turn_on',\n      'payload': { 'device_state': 'closed' }\n    },\n    {\n      'action': 'turn_off',\n      'payload': {}\n    }\n  ],\n  'state_topic': f'homeassistant/door_sensor',\n  'entity_id': 'light_switch.0'\n}\n'''\n\n# Print the blueprint to the console\nprint(blueprint)\n\ntry:\n    import voluptuous as vol\nexcept ImportError:\n    from homeassistant.helpers import validate_config_schema\n\nconfig = json.loads(blueprint)\nvalidate_config_schema(config, {'door_sensor', 'light_switch'})\n\n# Add an entity for DoorSensor\nDoorSensor = EntityRegistry.get_entity(STATE_ON, 'DoorSensor')\ndoor_sensor.add_automation(\n    {\n        'entity_id': DoorSensor.entity_id,\n        'name': 'DoorSensor',\n        'action': 'turn_on'\n    }\n)\n\n# Define actions to switch off the light when the door is closed\nactions = [\n    # When the door is closed, turn off the first LightSwitch\n    {'action': 'turn_off', 'payload': {}},\n]\n\nif 'light_switch' in DoorSensor:\n    entity_id = DoorSensor.entity_id\nelse:\n    action = None\n    light_switch_actions = [{'action': 'turn_on'}]\n    for light_switch in light_switch:\n        if door_sensor.has_action(light_switch.action, action):\n            # Turn on the light switch\n            light_switch.turn_on(light_switch.action)\n            break\n        else:\n            actions.append(\n                {\n                    'action': f'toggle_off_{light_switch.name}',\n                    'payload': {}\n                }\n            )\n\n    if actions:\n        DoorSensor.add_automation(actions)\n\n# Save the configuration changes to the database\ndoor_sensor.save_entity()\n```\n\n### 3. Testing\n\nTo test the automation, you can simulate door opening and closing using a voice assistant or device that supports interacting with Home Assistant.\n\nFor instance, you could have a simple voice assistant named 'Alexa' open and close a speaker connected to your home assistant. When Alexa turns on the light switch, it will turn on the speaker.\n\n### 4.

Define the `binary_sensor` for the Phone Call\n```python\n# Define the binary sensor for the phone call\nphone_call_sensor = BinarySensor('phone_call', 'Phone call status')\n```\n\n#### 2. Register the `binary_sensor` with Home Assistant\n\nThis step registers the `phone_call_sensor` to be notified of changes in its state.\n\n```python\ndef on_phone_call_sensor_state_change(call_button):\n    phone_call_sensor.state = True\n    # Add any code here if you want to send a message or handle other states after the change\n```\n\n#### 3. Define the Vacuum Entity\n```python\nvacuum_entity = Vacuum()\n```\n\n#### 4. Register the `vacuum_entity` with Home Assistant\n\nThis step registers the vacuum entity to be monitored and interacted with by Home Assistant.\n\n```python\ndef on_vacuum_stop():\n    # Pause the vacuum action (not stopped) if there's a call detected\n    if phone_call_sensor.state:\n        return False  # Return early, but continue processing other tasks\n\n    vacuum_entity.unpause()  # Resume the vacuum action after the pause\n\n# Add any additional actions or logic here\n```\n\n#### 5. Register the main component to handle changes\n```python\ndef on_main_component_removed(component_name):\n    pass\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n1. **Register the binary sensor**:\n   - Create a new `binary_sensor` named 'phone_call' and register it with Home Assistant.\n   - Add code to listen for changes in the `'phone_call'` state.\n\n2. **Define your vacuum action**:\n   - Define a function that pauses the vacuum if there's a call.\n\n3. **Register the vacuum entity**: \n   - Create a new `vacuum` entity and register it with Home Assistant.\n   - Add code to pause the vacuum (`vacuum_entity.unpause()`).\n\n4. **Add additional actions**:\n   - Depending on your application, add other components or actions.\n\n5. **Handle changes in the system (main component removal)**:\n\n   ```python\n   @main_component_removed\n   def on_main_component_removed(component_name):\n       pass\n   ```\n\n6. **Start monitoring and handling calls**:\n   - You can start monitoring for phone calls using `phone_call_sensor` once the blueprint is saved.\n   - Add code to call the action when a new phone call is received.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- This example provides a basic framework. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the actions and logic accordingly.\n- You can extend this automation with additional features such as automatic pauses during certain times of day or specific activities.\n\nRemember to replace `'phone_call'`, `'vacuum'` with actual names relevant in your Home Assistant configuration.","vacuum_pause-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","AssertionError: Blueprint content is not available"

When this sensor changes to 'on', it triggers the automation.\n  \n- The `condition` checks if the vacuum is in either 'cleaning' or 'docking' states before pausing. This ensures that the vacuum is actually running and not idle.\n\n- The `action` section pauses the specified vacuum when conditions are met, using the `vacuum.pause` service.\n\n4. **Inputs:**\n\n- Ensure you replace the example values with your actual entity IDs when creating the automation in Home Assistant.\n  \nTo use this blueprint:\n\n1.
